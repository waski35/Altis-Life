<b>Altis Life</b> or <b>[Altis Life RPG] (http://www.altisliferpg.com)</b> is developed by <b>Tonic</b> AKA <b>[TAW_Tonic] (https://github.com/TAWTonic)</b>.<br/>
This contains primarily the release contain and on-going development changes to the mission.<br/>
<br/>
Altis Life RPG by Tonic is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License] (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/deed.en_US)<br/>
By using the framework and/or code inside the framework, you agree to the [terms of agreement] (README.md/#usage--terms-of-agreement).<br/>
The terms are subjected to be changed over time.<br/>

This build is for [extDB2] (https://github.com/Torndeco/extdb2)
---------------------------------------------------------------
To setup extDB2 you need to use the Windows/Linux pre-compiled build and edit the <b>extdb-conf.ini</b> "MySQL_Example" field to "ArmaLife" with your Database name and login SQL user details, like this:
```
[ArmaLife]
Type = MySQL
Name = AltisLife

Username = MyDatabaseLogin
Password = MyDatabasePassword

IP = 127.0.0.1
Port = 3306
```
<br/>
Make sure the following files/folders are in the root directory of your ARMA 3 server files (where the exe is):<br/>
<b>Windows:</b>
```
ARMA_3_DIR
├ @extDB2
| ├ extdb-conf.ini
| └ extDB2.dll
└ tbbmalloc.dll
```
<b>Linux:</b>
```
ARMA_3_DIR
└ @extDB2
  ├ extdb-conf.ini
  └ extDB2.so
```

You can drag the extDB2.dll & extdb-conf.ini to root folder as well or you can copy over @extDB2 over as a regular mod. If you choose to use @extDB2 as a regular mod your commandline will be: <b>-mod=@life_server;@extDB2</b><br/>
<br/>
If you are not using @extDB2 as a mod and choose to drag extDB2.dll into the main arma 3 server directory then you only need @life_server in the commandline.
